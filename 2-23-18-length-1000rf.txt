I'm so fed up dealing with this guy in one of my classes! Seriously, I kept telling the
teaching staff about his behavior, reported his behavior multiple times and they won't do
anything to stop him, or at the very least not enough! Why? Because he won't stop bullying me
and others, so I'm not the only one he's harassing. If he won't stop his actions, and if the
administrative staff won't take action against him, I will have to take this into my own hands.

I might have to call the local law enforcement in my home town to deal with this situation if
the damn school won't do anything about it. I swear, if the police don't take any immediate 
action against this dude, I might drop out of high school entirely! Damn good thing he doesn't
have my phone number because if he did, I would straight up beat the hell out of him for his 
attitude! If he dare tries to physically get on me at any time, I'll straight up kill him with
goodness knows what kind of weapon!
